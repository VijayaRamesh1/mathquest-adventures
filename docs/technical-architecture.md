# MathQuest: Technical Architecture

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- React.js for UI components
- Three.js for interactive 3D visualizations
- MathJax for mathematical notation rendering

### Backend (Future Implementation)
- Node.js server
- MongoDB for user data storage
- Express.js for API endpoints

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Game Engine**
   - Manages game state and progression
   - Handles level loading and transitions
   - Processes user input and interactions

2. **Math Engine**
   - Evaluates mathematical expressions
   - Verifies solution correctness
   - Generates dynamic problems based on difficulty settings

3. **Visualization Engine**
   - Renders mathematical concepts visually
   - Creates interactive 3D graphs and models
   - Provides visual feedback for user actions

4. **User Interface**
   - Game controls and navigation
   - Mathematical input methods
   - Progress tracking and achievements

5. **Adaptive Learning System**
   - Tracks user performance
   - Adjusts difficulty based on learning patterns
   - Recommends specific practice areas

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with game interface
2. Input is processed by the Game Engine
3. Math Engine evaluates mathematical relevance
4. Visualization Engine updates visual representation
5. Adaptive Learning System records performance
6. Game state updates based on outcome

## State Management

- Redux for global state management
- Local storage for saving progress
- Future: Server-side state persistence

## Performance Considerations

- Optimization of 3D rendering for lower-end devices
- Lazy loading of game assets and levels
- Caching of frequently used mathematical calculations

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Web Prototype
- Static site hosting via GitHub Pages
- Client-side only functionality

### Phase 2: Full Stack Implementation
- Backend deployment on cloud platform (AWS/Azure)
- Database implementation for user accounts and progression

### Phase 3: Mobile Deployment
- React Native implementation for iOS/Android
- Native optimizations for mobile performance
